# Credit_Union_Scrape
This repo is for python scripts used to scrape data from NCUA quarterly call reports for credit Unions


The file takes a couple of inputs in the first section. You can name a time frame you are intersted in pulling data from.

The end output is a csv file that you can use to analyze data about credit unions

Enjoy!
