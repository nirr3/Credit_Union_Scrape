# Credit_Union_Scrape
This repo is for python scripts used to scrape data from NCUA quarterly call reports for credit unions and download them with headers on your laptop.

## What data is it retrieving?
These files consist of the quarterly Call Report financial and miscellaneous information from natural person credit unions available from March 1994. Each quarterâ€™s Zip file has comma delimited text files that can be easily imported into a spreadsheet or database program.

## How does it work?
The script takes a couple of inputs in the first section. You need to specify the start_year and end_year values. These values will determine the range of years you want to retreive data for.

The end output is a csv file that you can use to analyze data about credit unions

Enjoy!
